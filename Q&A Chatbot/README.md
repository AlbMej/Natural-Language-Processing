# Deep Learning Question & Answers Chatbot

An implementation of a Q&A Chatbot based on the following paper:
- Jason Weston, Antoine Bordes, Sumit Chopra, Tomas Mikolov, Alexander M. Rush,
  "Towards AI-Complete Question Answering: A Set of Prerequisite Toy Tasks",
  http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05698

The chatbot can answer questions based on a "story" (one or more sentences for context). It currently returns a binary answer (yes or no). 

I hope (if I have time) to incoporate a NLG component so the chatbot could return answers outside of yes or no. I also hope to include a real time speech to text
component because why not haha. That way you'd actually be able to talk to the chatbot. 

A job posting really sparked my interest for this project, so I am trying to implement something related to their job description. 

## TODOs
Just some todos for myself. 
Algo wants to build a Chatbot to allow business executive to talk to their data by asking natural English questions. They also expects their chatbot to understanding questions, and personalize the question prediction for each user according
to its question history.

I could extend the training and test set so the chat bot could answer questions more related to busines and data.
I will brain storm the rest after finishing some commitments. Its finals week :/
